# Cross-store invariants

This file documents the shared-connection store-split pattern used by
two façades:

- **`SessionDatabase`** — the global session DB at
  `~/Library/Application Support/Senkani/senkani.db`. Stores live
  under this directory (`Sources/Core/Stores/`).
- **`KnowledgeStore`** — a per-project knowledge vault at
  `<projectRoot>/.senkani/vault.db`. Stores live under
  `Sources/Core/KnowledgeStore/`.

Sections **I1–I9** cover SessionDatabase invariants (kept
unchanged). Sections **K1–K5** cover KnowledgeStore invariants — the
`luminary-2026-04-24-5-knowledgestore-split` round (2026-04-25)
adapted the same pattern to the knowledge vault and discovered which
of the I-rules apply unchanged, which apply with adjustments, and
which are unique to the entity-graph shape.

# SessionDatabase store invariants

The compatibility façade `SessionDatabase` (`Sources/Core/SessionDatabase.swift`)
delegates to four extracted stores under this directory:

| Store              | File                  | Tables owned end-to-end                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CommandStore`     | `CommandStore.swift`  | `sessions`, `commands`, `commands_fts` + FTS5 triggers     |
| `TokenEventStore`  | `TokenEventStore.swift` | `token_events`, `claude_session_cursors`                |
| `SandboxStore`     | `SandboxStore.swift`  | `sandboxed_results`                                        |
| `ValidationStore`  | `ValidationStore.swift` | `validation_results`                                     |

The façade itself retains `event_counters`, schema/version orchestration,
and the cross-store composition reads documented below.

The split was shipped under the `sessiondb-split-2` … `sessiondb-split-6`
rounds (Luminary P2-11, 2026-04-20 → 2026-04-24). Before adding a fifth
store, or before splitting `KnowledgeStore` / `LearnedRulesStore` along
the same pattern, read this doc — it is the rule-set the split rounds
discovered and is now the contract for the next ones.

## I1 — One connection, one queue, store-private writes

**Rule.** Every store shares the parent's `db` handle and the parent's
serial dispatch queue (`parent.queue`, label
`com.senkani.sessiondb`). Stores **must not** open a second SQLite
handle and **must not** dispatch onto their own queue. All reads and
writes flow through `parent.queue.sync` or `parent.queue.async`.

**Why.** SQLite's WAL mode tolerates concurrent readers but a single
process should still funnel writes through one mutex; the serial
queue *is* that mutex. It is also what makes single-statement writes
across stores globally ordered without explicit `BEGIN` — see I2.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SessionDatabaseTests.swift::twoProjectsGetSeparateStats`
  exercises a shared connection across stores in one process.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/CommandStoreTests.swift::fts5SyncPreservesConsistencyUnderSerialWrites`
  proves the serial-queue ordering keeps `commands_fts` consistent
  with `commands` under back-to-back writes.

## I2 — `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` is reserved for multi-statement writes

**Rule.** Today exactly one method wraps work in an explicit
transaction:

- `CommandStore.recordCommand` — `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` …
  `INSERT INTO commands` (which fires the FTS5 triggers) …
  `UPDATE sessions` … `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK on defer`. The boundary
  is load-bearing because search results would otherwise be visible
  before the session aggregate row updates, and aggregates would
  drift from the base table if the second statement failed.

Every other write today is a single statement and relies on the serial
queue (I1) for global ordering. That is the **only** correct shape
for new single-statement writes.

**Cross-store transactions are currently forbidden.** No method in the
façade or in any store opens a transaction that spans two stores'
tables. If a future feature genuinely needs one (e.g. "delete a
session and all its sandboxed results in one atomic step"), it must
be added with:

1. A new method on the façade (not on a store).
2. An explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` … `COMMIT` issued through
   `parent.queue.sync`.
3. A test that proves rollback under a forced second-statement
   failure.

Do not let cross-store transactions leak into a store class — the
store is allowed to assume it owns its tables.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/CommandStoreTests.swift::recordCommandUpdatesSessionAggregates`
  asserts the post-commit invariant (commands inserted ⇒ session
  aggregates updated).
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/CommandStoreTests.swift::fts5SyncPreservesConsistencyUnderSerialWrites`
  asserts FTS5 sync inside the same boundary.

## I3 — Public-API byte-identity (the façade contract)

**Rule.** Every public method exposed before the split must keep its
signature, semantics, and observable behavior. Callers stay on
`SessionDatabase.shared.<method>(…)`. Forwarders live in the four
`SessionDatabase+*API.swift` extension files. No callsite outside the
`Sources/Core/Stores/` directory and `SessionDatabase*.swift` may
reference a store type directly — `CommandStore`, `TokenEventStore`,
`SandboxStore`, `ValidationStore` are `internal` for that reason.

**Why.** The split is a refactor, not a redesign. AutoValidate,
HookRouter, MCPSession, `senkani` CLI subcommands, and the GUI panes
were all written against the pre-split surface. Any deviation is a
silent behavior change that bypasses code review.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SessionDatabaseTests.swift` — the entire file
  is the legacy-API conformance suite, exercised against the post-
  split façade.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/MCPSessionTests.swift` and
  `AutoValidateTests.swift` — real callers run unchanged against the
  façade.

## I4 — Project isolation: `project_root` filter on every cross-project read

**Rule.** Every read that aggregates across sessions for a single
project **must** filter by `project_root` (normalized via
`SessionDatabase.normalizePath`). The two tables that carry
`project_root` directly are:

- `sessions.project_root` (added by `CommandStore` migration)
- `token_events.project_root` (column on the base schema)

Cross-store reads on the façade — `lastExecResult`,
`lastSessionActivity`, `tokenStatsByAgent`, `complianceRate` —
each take `projectRoot` as the first scoping argument and apply
the filter explicitly.

**Asymmetry — known and intentional.** `sandboxed_results` and
`validation_results` carry `session_id` only; they do **not** carry
`project_root`. They are session-scoped (24-hour retention,
session-keyed advisories) and the existing surface never asks
"all sandboxed results for project X". If a future feature needs
project-scoped reads on those tables, prefer joining through
`sessions.project_root` rather than denormalizing — and add a test
that proves another project's session never leaks.

`event_counters` carries `project_root` as its primary key half;
process-global events are stored under `project_root = ""`. Callers
must pass `""` explicitly to read process-global counters.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SessionDatabaseTests.swift::nullProjectRootDoesNotContaminateNamedProjects`
  guards token-event project isolation.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SessionDatabaseTests.swift::twoProjectsGetSeparateStats`
  guards the same on aggregate reads.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SessionDatabaseTests.swift::trailingSlashNormalized`
  and the surrounding normalization tests guard
  `normalizePath`'s correctness.
- **Gap:** `complianceRate` and `lastExecResult` have no direct
  tests for project isolation. Filed as a follow-up in
  `spec/cleanup.md`.

## I5 — `token_events` is the single source of truth, with one writer

**Rule.** `token_events` has exactly **one** writer: `TokenEventStore`.
Reads happen from three places, by design:

- `TokenEventStore` itself — every `token_events`-only analytics
  read (`tokenStatsForProject`, `liveSessionMultiplier`,
  `recentTokenEvents`, `hotFiles`, `pruneTokenEvents`, …).
- `SessionDatabase` (the façade) — only when the read joins
  `token_events` against another store's table. Today those are
  `lastExecResult` (× `commands`), `lastSessionActivity` (×
  `sessions`), `tokenStatsByAgent` (× `sessions`),
  `complianceRate` (token_events alone but expressed as a
  hook-vs-MCP aggregate that's not meaningfully owned by one
  store).
- `SessionDatabaseExport` — read-only, redaction-aware, single-
  shot dump for `senkani export` and tests.

**Why.** Multiple writers would race the timestamp/cursor invariants
that downstream readers depend on (compound-learning H+2 patterns,
the live-session multiplier gate, the timeline pane). Multiple
writers would also force a per-row source-of-truth tag, which the
existing `source` column intentionally does not provide.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/TokenEventStoreTests.swift::recordTokenEventPersistsAllFields`
  pins the writer surface.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/TokenEventStoreTests.swift::recordHookEventLandsInTokenEventsWithHookSource`
  pins the hook-event path that uses the same writer.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/AgentTrackingTests.swift::tokenStatsByAgentGroupsCorrectly`
  pins a representative cross-store JOIN read.

## I6 — Persistence redaction is mandatory at every disk-bound write

**Rule.** Any column that carries agent-supplied or shell-supplied
text must pass through `PersistenceRedaction.redact` (or its
`redactedString` variant) before binding. The three writers that
honor this contract today are:

- `CommandStore.recordCommand` — `command` and `output_preview`.
- `TokenEventStore.recordTokenEvent` — `command`.
- `SandboxStore.storeSandboxedResult` — `command` and the full
  output (and the line/byte counts are computed from the
  **redacted** form so retrieval matches the summary).

`ValidationStore` does not redact `raw_output` today because the
output is structured validator stderr, not agent-supplied prose;
add redaction if the validator surface ever broadens to capture
arbitrary command output.

`CommandStore.recordCommand` also bumps the
`security.command.redacted` counter on the `event_counters` table
when the redactor matches, so `senkani stats --security` can show
the rate.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/CommandStoreTests.swift::recordCommandRedactsSecrets`.
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SandboxStoreTests.swift` round-trip tests
  verify that retrieved output matches the redacted-on-write form.
- See also `Tests/SenkaniTests/PersistenceRedactionTests.swift`
  for the redactor itself.

## I7 — Logging contract: `db.<scope>.<outcome>` only

**Rule.** Every DB-init / SQL-error path inside the façade and the
four stores emits through `Logger.log` using the
`db.<scope>.<outcome>` event vocabulary — never `print(...)`. Stable
event names are `db.session.open_failed`,
`db.session.migrations_applied`, `db.session.migration_failed`,
`db.command.sql_error`, `db.sandbox.sql_error`,
`db.validation.sql_error`. Each event tags `outcome=success|error`.
Open events also tag `mode=default|test` and use `LogValue.path(...)`
for the DB path so home-directory prefixes are redacted at emit
(Cavoukian C2).

**Why.** A `print` from a daemon-side store leaks into stdout, which
is the MCP wire protocol — exactly the regression that Lesson #N
caught.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/LoggerRoutingTests.swift::sourceHasNoLegacyPrintInScopedFiles`
  fails the build if any of those files reintroduces a
  `print("[Component] …")` line.

## I8 — Cache-key conventions for the future store splits

The current `Sources/Core/Stores/` stores do **not** maintain
content-keyed caches. The convention exists in `IndexEngine.swift`,
`HookRouter.swift`, `KBLayer1Coordinator.swift`, and
`ProjectFingerprint.swift`, where it is:

- File-content cache key = **path + mtime**
  (`hashes[file] = "<size>-<mtime_seconds>"` in `IndexEngine`,
  `attrs[.modificationDate]` checks in `HookRouter` and
  `SessionBriefGenerator`).
- Project-scope cache key = **max source mtime under the project root**
  (`ProjectFingerprint` walks the tree because directory mtime is
  unreliable on macOS — see the comment block at the top of
  `Sources/Core/ProjectFingerprint.swift`).
- Command-result cache key = **command_hash + input file mtimes**
  is the convention reserved for upcoming `KnowledgeStore` /
  `LearnedRulesStore` splits.

When `KnowledgeStore` (929 LOC) and `LearnedRulesStore` (844 LOC) are
split, every sub-store that caches must (1) include path + mtime in
the key, (2) use `ProjectFingerprint` for project-scope keys (never
the directory mtime), and (3) document the key shape next to the
table schema.

## I9 — Schema migrations belong to the façade

**Rule.** `MigrationRunner.run` is invoked exactly once, by
`SessionDatabase.runMigrations`, after all stores have called their
`setupSchema`. Stores own `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and idempotent
`ALTER TABLE` for their tables only. Cross-store schema changes (a
new index that joins two tables, a column that affects two stores)
must land as a numbered migration in
`Sources/Core/Migrations.swift`, not as an `execSilent` ALTER inside
a store's `setupSchema`.

**Why.** The version stamp on the DB (`PRAGMA user_version`) is what
`senkani doctor` reports and what the migration kill-switch
lockfile checks. A store-local schema bump that doesn't land as a
numbered migration leaves the DB in a state that can't be diagnosed
or rolled forward.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/SessionDatabaseTests.swift` — "Opening same DB
  twice runs migrations twice without crash".
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/CommandStoreTests.swift::schemaSurvivesReopen`.

## Appendix — store-by-store quick reference

```
CommandStore
  Tables       : sessions, commands, commands_fts (+3 FTS5 triggers)
  project_root : sessions.project_root (filter on every cross-session read)
  Transactions : recordCommand wraps INSERT commands + UPDATE sessions
  Redaction    : command, output_preview
  Notes        : commands_fts is the only FTS5 surface. Triggers AI/AD/AU
                 keep it in sync; do not add a parallel writer to commands
                 without re-checking the trigger contract.

TokenEventStore
  Tables       : token_events, claude_session_cursors
  project_root : token_events.project_root (single source of truth — see I5)
  Transactions : single-statement writes, serialized via parent.queue
  Redaction    : command
  Notes        : The 90-day prune (pruneTokenEvents) is the only retention
                 policy for analytics history. Cursors are per-path, not
                 per-session — that's deliberate so a stopped session
                 doesn't lose its place.

SandboxStore
  Tables       : sandboxed_results
  project_root : NOT carried (session-scoped — see I4 asymmetry note)
  Transactions : single-statement, serialized via parent.queue
  Redaction    : command, full_output (line/byte counts post-redaction)
  Notes        : 24-hour prune via RetentionScheduler. ID format is
                 `r_<12-hex>` so the MCP tool stream can return a
                 compact retrieval pointer.

ValidationStore
  Tables       : validation_results
  project_root : NOT carried (session-scoped — see I4 asymmetry note)
  Transactions : single-statement, serialized via parent.queue
  Redaction    : NOT applied to raw_output today (validator stderr is
                 structured, not agent prose). Revisit if scope broadens.
  Notes        : `surfaced_at` is the source of truth for "this advisory
                 was already shown"; `delivered` stays for legacy UI.

## Appendix — coverage gaps tracked in `spec/cleanup.md`

- `SessionDatabase.complianceRate` has no direct test — the file uses
  it indirectly through MCP/hook flows.
- `SessionDatabase.lastExecResult` has no direct test — it is a
  cross-store JOIN that should have a unit test pinning project
  isolation, missing-row, and the `output_preview ABS(timestamp - ?) < 2.0`
  fuzziness.

These are tracked as follow-ups under "SessionDatabase store
coverage gaps" in `spec/cleanup.md`.

# KnowledgeStore store invariants

The compatibility façade `KnowledgeStore`
(`Sources/Core/KnowledgeStore.swift`) delegates to four extracted
stores under `Sources/Core/KnowledgeStore/`:

| Store              | File                          | Tables owned end-to-end                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `EntityStore`      | `EntityStore.swift`           | `knowledge_entities`, `knowledge_fts` + 3 FTS5 triggers |
| `LinkStore`        | `LinkStore.swift`             | `entity_links` + 3 indexes                              |
| `DecisionStore`    | `DecisionStore.swift`         | `decision_records` + `entity_name` index + `idx_decisions_commit` partial unique |
| `EnrichmentStore`  | `EnrichmentStore.swift`       | `evidence_timeline`, `co_change_coupling` + indexes     |

The façade itself retains the connection / queue lifecycle, the
WAL + `foreign_keys=ON` pragmas, and the per-store `setupSchema`
ordering at construction time. Forwarders for the public surface live
in `Sources/Core/KnowledgeStore+EntityAPI.swift`,
`+LinkAPI.swift`, `+DecisionAPI.swift`, `+EnrichmentAPI.swift`.

The split was shipped under
`luminary-2026-04-24-5-knowledgestore-split` (2026-04-25). I1, I2 (in
its narrower KnowledgeStore form), I3, I7 (relaxed — see K5), I8 (NA
today) and I9 (NA — there is no `MigrationRunner` for the knowledge
vault yet) carry over from the SessionDatabase set. The five rules
below are the KnowledgeStore-specific contract.

## K1 — One connection, one queue (per-vault)

**Rule.** Every KnowledgeStore sub-store shares the parent's `db`
handle and the parent's serial dispatch queue (`parent.queue`, label
`com.senkani.knowledgestore`). Sub-stores **must not** open a second
SQLite handle and **must not** dispatch onto their own queue. All
reads and writes flow through `parent.queue.sync` or
`parent.queue.async`.

**Why.** Same reasoning as I1 for SessionDatabase. A second connection
would race the WAL invariants and bypass the FTS5 trigger ordering
that EntityStore depends on. The per-project knowledge vault is
small enough that one writer is the right capacity model.

**Tests.**
- `KnowledgeEntityStoreTests::ftsSyncRemainsConsistentUnderBackToBackWrites`
  exercises the serial-queue ordering across the FTS5 triggers.
- `KnowledgeEntityStoreTests::batchIncrementAppliesAllDeltasOnce`
  exercises a multi-row write through the same queue.

## K2 — Cross-store FKs are enforced at the connection, not the store

**Rule.** Three sub-store tables hold foreign-key references to
`knowledge_entities` (owned by EntityStore):

- `entity_links.source_id REFERENCES knowledge_entities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- `entity_links.target_id REFERENCES knowledge_entities(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`
- `decision_records.entity_id REFERENCES knowledge_entities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- `evidence_timeline.entity_id REFERENCES knowledge_entities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`

These FKs are enforced by SQLite at row-write time once
`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` is set on the connection — which the façade
does, exactly once, in `enableWAL`. **Cascade behavior is therefore a
property of the connection, not of any individual store.** Sub-stores
declare the FK in their `setupSchema` and rely on the façade to keep
the pragma on.

**Why.** This is the one place where DDL crosses store boundaries.
Pulling the cascade rule into each store would force them to know
about each other's tables; relying on SQLite's referential integrity
keeps the stores ignorant.

**Tests.**
- `KnowledgeLinkStoreTests::cascadeDeleteOnSourceEntityRemoval`
- `KnowledgeLinkStoreTests::targetIdSetNullOnTargetEntityDelete`
- `KnowledgeDecisionStoreTests::cascadeDeleteOnEntityRemoval`
- `KnowledgeEnrichmentStoreTests::evidenceCascadeDeleteOnEntityRemoval`

If `foreign_keys=ON` is ever lost, all four of these tests fail —
which is the regression net. Do not move FK enforcement into a
defensive Swift check; it would be slower and would diverge from the
SQL contract at the database level.

## K3 — `EnrichmentStore` is a deliberate two-table composition

**Rule.** `EnrichmentStore` owns both `evidence_timeline` (entity-keyed,
session-derived, append-only) and `co_change_coupling` (pair-keyed,
git-derived, idempotent upsert). The two tables share an aggregate
identity — "what we've learned about entities" — but have different
lifecycles.

**Why.** Both are downstream artifacts of the enrichment pipeline
(compound learning fills the timeline; the coupling miner fills the
pair table). Neither is large enough on its own to justify a fifth
sub-store; merging them keeps the file count reasonable and groups
the enrichment-pipeline contract in one place.

**What this rule blocks.** Reusing `EnrichmentStore` as a catch-all
for "anything entity-graph-adjacent." If a future feature needs a
table that is neither (a) directly fed by the enrichment pipeline nor
(b) a downstream learned-signal artifact, it must go in a new store
or get a justified split — not piled into this one.

**Tests.**
- `KnowledgeEnrichmentStoreTests::schemaSurvivesReopen` exercises
  both tables on a single reopen.
- `KnowledgeEnrichmentStoreTests::evidenceCascadeDeleteOnEntityRemoval`
  pins the timeline lifecycle.
- `KnowledgeEnrichmentStoreTests::couplingUpsertIdempotentUnderBurst`
  pins the coupling lifecycle.

## K4 — FTS5 triggers travel with the parent table

**Rule.** The three triggers that keep `knowledge_fts` in sync with
`knowledge_entities` (`knowledge_fts_ai`, `_ad`, `_au`) are owned by
`EntityStore` and live in its `setupSchema`. No other store may
write to `knowledge_entities`, and no other store may add a parallel
writer to `knowledge_fts`.

**Why.** The FTS5 contract is fragile: a `content=` external-content
table relies on the triggers to keep its inverted index aligned. A
parallel writer to `knowledge_entities` outside this store would
silently bypass the triggers and leave search results stale; a
parallel writer to `knowledge_fts` would corrupt the BM25 ranks.
Mirrors the `commands_fts` rule in `CommandStore`.

**Tests.**
- `KnowledgeEntityStoreTests::ftsSyncRemainsConsistentUnderBackToBackWrites`
  proves the triggers stay aligned across many serialised inserts.
- `KnowledgeEntityStoreTests::schemaSurvivesReopen` reopens the DB
  and exercises a fresh FTS query, proving triggers are present
  after re-init.

## K5 — Partial unique index dedup is a `DecisionStore` invariant

**Rule.** `DecisionStore` declares an `idx_decisions_commit` partial
unique index:

```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_commit
ON decision_records(entity_name, commit_hash)
WHERE source = 'git_commit' AND commit_hash IS NOT NULL;
```

This index is the source of truth for "one decision per
(entity_name, commit_hash) for git-archaeology rows." It is created
via `execSilent` because the partial-index syntax can vary between
SQLite builds; failing to create it is non-fatal (callers tolerate
duplicate git_commit rows degrading silently to no-op dedup).

`source != 'git_commit'` rows (annotations, agent-emitted decisions,
CLI-emitted decisions) are NEVER deduped — repeats are intentional
because they reflect repeated observation.

**Why.** The legacy `KnowledgeStore` already encoded this; the split
makes the contract local to `DecisionStore` so the rule does not
diffuse into the façade. Without the partial-unique constraint,
re-mining the same git history would multiply decision rows linearly
in passes.

**Tests.**
- `KnowledgeDecisionStoreTests::nonGitCommitSourcesCanRepeat` —
  lock down that other sources are never deduped.
- `KnowledgeDecisionStoreTests::gitCommitDifferentHashAllowed` —
  same name, different hash → both rows survive.
- The legacy `KnowledgeStoreDecisionsTests::gitCommitDecisionDeduped`
  pins the dedup behavior end-to-end via the public façade.

**Logging note (relaxation of I7).** KnowledgeStore sub-stores still
emit DB errors via `fputs("[KnowledgeStore] …", stderr)` rather than
`Logger.log("db.<scope>.<outcome>", …)`. The
`LoggerRoutingTests::sourceHasNoLegacyPrintInScopedFiles` regression
test scopes only to the SessionDatabase set; aligning the
KnowledgeStore stores with I7 is filed as a follow-up. New code in
this directory must keep using `fputs` (not `print`) until that
follow-up lands so the existing scoped regression net continues to
hold.

# LearnedRulesStore invariants

The `LearnedRulesStore` façade
(`Sources/Core/LearnedRulesStore.swift`) sits over a single
JSON-on-disk file (`~/.senkani/learned-rules.json`) and four bounded
contexts that share it. The `luminary-2026-04-24-6-learnedrulesstore-split`
round (2026-04-25) extracted each artifact's lifecycle into its own
file under `Sources/Core/LearnedRules/`, mirroring the *spirit* of the
SessionDatabase P2-11 pattern even though the storage substrate is
completely different (JSON file, not SQLite). The rules below are
narrower than I1–I9 because the substrate is simpler, but they are
load-bearing for every per-artifact extension.

| Bounded context     | File                              | Artifact type            | Dedup key                  |

| Instruction patches | `LearnedRules/InstructionPatchStore.swift`  | `LearnedInstructionPatch`  | `(toolName, hint)`           |
| Workflow playbooks  | `LearnedRules/WorkflowPlaybookStore.swift`  | `LearnedWorkflowPlaybook`  | `title` (sanitized slug)     |

The façade itself owns the cross-cutting types (`LearnedRuleStatus`,
`LearnedArtifact`, `LearnedRulesFile`) and the shared persistence
infrastructure (`load`/`save`/`shared` cache, `withPath` test
override, `reset`).

## LRS1 — Single shared cache, single shared file

**Rule.** Every per-artifact extension reads from
`LearnedRulesStore.load() ?? .empty`, mutates the resulting
`LearnedRulesFile`, then `save()`s the whole file and assigns
`shared = file`. There is exactly one process-wide on-disk file
(`learned-rules.json`) and exactly one in-memory cache
(`_defaultShared`) at any moment outside a `withPath(_:)` scope.

**Why.** All four artifact lifecycles share the same JSON container
because `LearnedArtifact` is a discriminated union and the file shape
is `{ "version": N, "artifacts": [{ "type": ..., "payload": ... }] }`.
Splitting the storage across four files would make migrations and the
`LearnedRulesFile` v3→v4→v5 evolution incoherent.

**Tests.**
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/LearnedRules/FilterRuleStoreTests.swift`
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/LearnedRules/ContextDocStoreTests.swift`
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/LearnedRules/InstructionPatchStoreTests.swift`
- `Tests/SenkaniTests/LearnedRules/WorkflowPlaybookStoreTests.swift`
  Each suite asserts that observe → load → mutate round-trips through
  the shared cache without losing artifacts of *other* types.

## LRS2 — Mutations are read-modify-write, single-writer assumed

**Rule.** Every mutation method is shaped:

```swift
var file = load() ?? .empty
// … mutate file.artifacts in place …
try save(file)
shared = file
```

There is **no** locking, queueing, or transactional boundary. The
rule the codebase relies on today is "the agent + daily sweep are
the only writers and they don't overlap." A future concurrent writer
must add a serial queue **before** introducing parallelism — there is
no LearnedRulesStore equivalent of SessionDatabase's I1.

**Why.** The on-disk file is small (KB-scale), the access pattern is
human-tempo, and a single sweep job is the only background writer.
Making this transactional today would be premature; making it
explicit in this doc prevents a future contributor from assuming
otherwise.

**Tests.** No concurrency-stress test today. If a second writer is
ever introduced, add one that observes interleaved writes against
two artifact types and asserts no artifact is lost.

## LRS3 — Public API byte-identity (the façade contract)

**Rule.** Callers see only `LearnedRulesStore.<staticMethod>(...)`.
The split moved methods to extensions on `LearnedRulesStore`, not to
new types — `FilterRuleStore` etc. are *file labels*, not Swift
types. Callers don't need to know which file a method lives in. If
you add a new artifact type, follow the same shape: an extension on
`LearnedRulesStore` whose methods are namespaced by artifact-name
suffix (e.g. `observeContextDoc`, not `ContextDocStore.observe`).

**Why.** The 20+ caller sites recorded at refactor time
(`grep -rl LearnedRulesStore\\.` from
`luminary-2026-04-24-6-learnedrulesstore-split`) all use the static-API
shape. Forcing them to a new namespace would have been a flag-day
change with no observable benefit.

## LRS4 — `LearnedArtifact` discriminated union stays in the façade

**Rule.** The `LearnedArtifact` enum, the `LearnedRulesFile` container,
and `LearnedRuleStatus` belong to `LearnedRulesStore.swift`. Adding a
fifth artifact type means: new case in `LearnedArtifact` + new
view-property on `LearnedRulesFile` + new file under
`LearnedRules/<Name>Store.swift` + new tests under
`Tests/SenkaniTests/LearnedRules/<Name>StoreTests.swift`.

**Why.** The discriminated-union tag is the schema contract. Splitting
it across files would force every per-artifact file to know about
every other artifact's tag string — the opposite of the bounded
context split.

LearnedRulesStore (façade)
  Owns         : LearnedRuleStatus, LearnedArtifact, LearnedRulesFile,
                 _defaultPath / _defaultShared, withPath, load, save,
                 reload, reset
  Storage      : ~/.senkani/learned-rules.json (atomic write, pretty + sorted-keys)
  Cache        : process-wide _defaultShared OR @TaskLocal Scoped box
                 inside `withPath(_:)`
  Concurrency  : single-writer assumed (LRS2). No locks, no queues today.

FilterRuleStore     (extension methods on LearnedRulesStore)
  Methods      : observe, stage (deprecated), promoteToStaged, apply,
                 applyAll, reject, setEnrichedRationale, loadApplied,
                 loadRecurring
  Owns type    : LearnedFilterRule (moved from façade in this round)

ContextDocStore     (extension methods)
  Methods      : observeContextDoc, promoteContextDocToStaged,
                 applyContextDoc, rejectContextDoc, contextDocs,
                 appliedContextDocs
  Owns helper  : private mutateContextDoc

InstructionPatchStore     (extension methods)
  Methods      : observeInstructionPatch, promoteInstructionPatchToStaged,
                 applyInstructionPatch, rejectInstructionPatch,
                 instructionPatches, appliedInstructionPatches
  Owns helper  : private mutateInstructionPatch
  Constraint   : Schneier — apply ONLY moves staged → applied. The daily
                 sweep promotes recurring → staged but is forbidden from
                 going staged → applied.

WorkflowPlaybookStore     (extension methods)
  Methods      : observeWorkflowPlaybook, promoteWorkflowPlaybookToStaged,
                 applyWorkflowPlaybook, rejectWorkflowPlaybook,
                 workflowPlaybooks
  Owns helper  : private mutateWorkflowPlaybook
